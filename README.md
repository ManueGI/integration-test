# Integration Test

## Step 1 : Fork this repository on your own Github account

## Step 2 : Clone your forked repository on your local environment

## Step 3 : Integrate the website with HTML & CSS

Thank to `design.png`, open & edit the `index.html` file. All the text content is already included in HTML comments, the Font is already loaded from `Google Font` & the image assets are already loaded in the `img` folder.

Just focus on creating the HTML structure of the page, and the CSS style.

## Step 3 : Add some interaction with Javascript

Create the javascript file that will help you make the review block & the features block animated like a carousel. Review block animation is controller by the dots, feature block is animated by the arrows. The animation should also be automatically triggered every 5 seconds to switch to the next carousel panel.
